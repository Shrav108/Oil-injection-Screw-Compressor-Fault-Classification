# Oil-injection-Screw-Compressor-Fault-Classification

1. This is a Machine Learning Program to classify Screw-Compressor Faults using Short Time Fourier Transform Spectrograms
2. Vibration signals are converted to spectrograms.
3. A Deep Learning Model is trained to predict fault states using spectrograms.

### Fault Description

There are total of 5 states for the model to predict.
1. Normal Condition
2. Unbalance Condition
3. Belt Looseness Condition
4. Belt Looseness High Condition
5. Bearing Fault Condition
